This program prints a friendly greeting on the serial console,
then goes into a loop blinking both on board LED's.

This is the first bit of code I try to get running on the
armv8 OrangePi PC -- 11-8-2018

The red LED is the "status LED" on GPIO A, pin 15
The gree LED is the "power LED" on GPIO L, pin 10
