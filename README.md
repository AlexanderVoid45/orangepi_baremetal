This is a collection of programs I have been writing to run on
the Orange Pi PC board.  They are what you might call "bare-metal"
programming, although they get loaded by U-Boot.

I also provide a disassembly of the H3 bootrom that I am working
on annotating and studying as I find time.

For lots of notes and supporting information, see my website:

If you want to follow my work in order, take them like this:

1. hello - first output to the serial port
2. blink - blink both on board LED's
3. core - get a second CPU core to fire up
